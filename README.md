**svg-generator**

In this week's challenge, I was tasked with creating an SVG generator that generates a logo consisting of 3 characters within a shape. In addition, it is a requirement that a user is able to choose a color for the shape and the text within the shape.

To run my application, you will need to download my repository as a ZIP file or clone my respository using your terminal.

Following this, make sure you are in the `svg-generator` folder using VSC and run these commands to initiate the application:

    npm run start

Once the application has created a logo for you, you can test the application  by running this command in the terminal:

    npm run test

Here is a link to a video showcasing and testing my application!
